# News-Headline-Aggregator
I created a news headline aggregator on February 11, 2023 and this is my very first github posting. I created this in python and I used an api from newsapi.org. I hope that my code helps someone else with their own personal projects. This aggregator currently only works for headlines from the United States but if someone wanted to change it to another country they could change the two letter code to something else like 'ru' for Russia.
